function mainhandles = checkScreenResolution(mainhandles)
% Checks the screen resolution registered by MATLAB. If screenpixelsperinch
% is 116 in win7, it is likely because zooming is activated unintensionally
%
%    Input:
%     mainhandles    - handles structure of the main window. Must contain a
%                      field settings.startup.zoomMessage and an editbox
%                      with handle handles.mboard
